# Marine Perch Hub

A collaborative resource for the biology, ecology, and taxonomy of deep-sea ocean perch.

## Goal
This project aims to provide a centralized, community-vetted source of information for researchers, aquarists, and commercial fishers interested in species like the Bigeye Ocean Perch (*Helicolenus barathri*).

## Structure
- `/species/`: Directory for individual species profiles (e.g., `helicolenus_barathri.md`).
- `/references/`: A curated list of key scientific literature and resources.
